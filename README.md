This project is a basic model training algorythm to predict house pricing based on size in square meters and number of bedrooms.
The project find the best value (from 0.1 to 1, increment by 0.1) for a learning rate, then compares losses for 2 different settings:
  - only using house size;
  - both size and number of bedrooms.
In the end, you can try inputing some values by yourself to check if it predicts accurately.

IMPORTANT! It is not 100% accurate, and the way to impove it is to add another argument.
You can do it by yourself iy you want to!
